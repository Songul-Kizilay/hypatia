# Milestone ledger

Hand-edited at milestone boundaries only (never generated), so it does not
dirty the tree during work. The Lead updates it when a milestone is defined;
Release records the delivered SHA and CI in the next milestone's first commit.
Live CI for `HEAD` is reported at session start by `.claude/hooks/hypatia_guard.py`.

Status values: planned, implementation, qa, release, ci-pending, delivered.
`delivered` requires verified reachability from `origin/main` (CLAUDE.md's
"Default-branch integration"), not merely green exact-SHA CI on the
development branch — `release`/`ci-pending` cover that intermediate state.

| Blockers | none |

Rationale (repository archaeology, 2026-09-22): with Evaluate -> Adapt v1,
Phase 7 hardening and v0.3.399 all settled (see the prior documentation
reconciliation commit `f5710aa`), the roadmap's own "Default development
order" flags item 3 (Tool registry + policy engine) as authority-adjacent
and requiring an explicit human check-in before autonomous work — so it
was not picked. Two parallel investigations (hypatia-runtime,
hypatia-epistemics) evidenced two safely-boundable candidates instead:

1. A desktop-visible source-revalidation flow (Phase 5's "[ ] User-facing
   revalidation workflow"): confirmed genuinely, completely unreachable
   from the desktop today (not merely buried — `SourceRevalidationStepBinding`
   is constructed nowhere in `src/` outside its own plumbing and three test
   files), reusing 100% existing same-run authority/budget.
2. Wiring the already-delivered, already-tested Evaluate -> Adapt v1
   continuation-proposal mechanism (v0.3.396) into the desktop: confirmed
   `ResearchMissionAuditApplicationService.proposal_for` "is not wired to
   any `BrainRequest` intent or desktop action" (grep across `src/desktop`
   returns no matches for `proposal_for`/`ContinuationProposal`/
   `seed_question`), and CHANGELOG.md's own v0.3.396 entry says so
   explicitly: "No new desktop UI; this is a backend/service-layer seam
   only." Hypatia's current top-level roadmap priority (Phase 6) is
   therefore, today, completely unusable by an actual operator through the
   product — it exists only as a backend service plus an end-to-end test.

Chosen: **(2)**. It closes the more foundational gap — the flagship
capability of the current phase has zero access path — while (1) remains
a strong, independently-valid future candidate (recorded below as
residual/future work, not discarded).

Scope: (1) a new read-only Brain intent (e.g.
`research_mission_continuation_proposal_preview`) that calls the EXISTING,
UNMODIFIED `ResearchMissionAuditApplicationService.proposal_for(plan_id)`
for a selected closed mission and returns either the proposal (with its
existing provenance fields: `origin_run_id`, `origin_plan_digest`,
`origin_stop_reason`, `origin_goal_status`, `origin_evidence_status`,
`origin_evidence_limitations`, `seed_question`) or an explicit,
accurate "not eligible" explanation — never a fabricated proposal, never a
guessed reason; (2) a `DesktopController` method mirroring the existing
`preview_mission_audit_export`/`preview_plan_authorization` read-only
pattern; (3) a "View continuation proposal" button beside the existing
mission-audit controls in "3 Authored analysis" -> "Plan draft" (same
panel as v0.3.399's traceability view, for the same reason: that's where
an operator already reviews a closed mission's result) showing the
proposal read-only; (4) one convenience action, "Use this proposal's
question," that does nothing except `self._research_question.set(seed_question)`
on the desktop's existing question `StringVar` (the exact field
`_preview_question_plan`/`_start_research_goal`/`_select_question_plan`
already read from for manual entry) — zero Brain/network/authorization
calls of its own. After that, the operator walks the entire existing,
byte-for-byte-unmodified preview -> authorize -> start chain themselves,
exactly as if they had typed the question by hand.

Non-goals: no new authority/budget primitive; no auto-approval or
auto-start of a proposal — approving still requires the full manual
preview -> authorize -> start walk, unchanged; no new eligibility rule
(reuses `proposal_for`'s existing `unresolved`/`partially_satisfied`-only
gate exactly as-is; `blocked`/`budget_limited` stay ineligible, matching
the v0.3.396 product decision); no "replanning diff" computation beyond
showing the proposal's own already-existing provenance fields — no new
comparison/judgment logic invented; no change to
`ResearchMissionContinuationProposal`, `continuation_proposal_for`, or
`proposal_for` themselves; no change to Evaluate -> Adapt v2, revalidation,
cancellation, or persistence-store code; does not implement the
budget-refusal-reason-persistence gap or the desktop-visible
source-revalidation flow found during archaeology (both recorded as
residual/future work below, not discarded).

Acceptance criteria: for an eligible closed mission, the new intent
returns a proposal identical to calling `proposal_for(plan_id)` directly
(equality-tested, same idiom as v0.3.399's traceability-graph equivalence
test); for an ineligible mission, an explicit accurate explanation, never
a crash or a fabricated proposal; the convenience button triggers zero
Brain/network calls and, after it fires, the existing preview -> authorize
-> start chain behaves byte-for-byte identically to manual entry
(extending `tests/e2e/test_continuation_proposal_reentry.py`'s existing
proof to the desktop path); no existing Brain intent, `DesktopController`
method, or `TkinterDesktopWindow` behavior changes; full canonical gates
green.

Security implications: the new surface renders a proposal's
`seed_question` (verbatim operator-authored text from the ORIGIN mission,
not external/untrusted content) and typed provenance IDs — no new
untrusted-content-rendering surface beyond what v0.3.399 already
established a pattern for. The convenience button must be proven to make
no Brain call itself (pure `StringVar` population) — this is the one
specific thing hypatia-security must independently trace.

Epistemic implications: none new — `proposal_for`'s existing fail-closed
eligibility gate is reused unchanged; this milestone must not add a
second eligibility check that could disagree with it.

Persistence/replay/restart implications: none — the new intent is a pure
read reusing `proposal_for`'s existing pure-function, nothing-persisted
derivation; nothing new is written, so restart/replay is unaffected by
construction.

Authority/budget/target/credential implications: none — no new primitive
of any kind; the only executable path remains the existing, unmodified
authorization chain, reached only through the operator's own explicit
manual walk-through, exactly as today.

Rationale (repository archaeology, 2026-09-22): Master_Roadmap.md was
reconciled at v0.3.395 and is stale relative to v0.3.396-398. Two apparent
"next in order" candidates were investigated and ruled out with evidence
before this milestone was chosen.

Evaluate -> Adapt v2 (bounded source-revalidation proposal): the fetch-based
`source_revalidation` plan step (v0.3.393) is a hard single-run construct at
three independent layers (`SourceRevalidationStepBinding`'s single
`research_run_id` field, `SourceRevalidationStepOperation.run()`'s explicit
same-run refusal, `ResearchRunManager`'s hardcoded
`earlier_run_id=later_run_id=run.run_id`), with a dedicated refusing test
(`tests/research/test_source_revalidation_step_operation.py::test_cross_run_provenance_is_refused_without_authority`).
Real cross-mission revalidation linking requires new cross-mission
authority/budget-boundary design — out of scope for autonomous execution
per this constitution's stop conditions.

Phase 7 persistence/cancellation/timeout hardening: confirmed already
substantially implemented and tested (`src/core/CancellationSignal.py`,
`ResearchPlanExecutionApplicationService.process_cancel`, distinct
`CANCELLED`/`INTERRUPTED` statuses, `cancelled != failed` and
`interrupted != failed` both directly proven by
`tests/research/test_research_plan_execution_state.py`,
`tests/research/test_concurrent_execution_state.py`,
`tests/research/test_research_plan_execution_snapshot.py`; real per-request
LLM/HTTP/Kali timeouts already exist). Master_Roadmap.md's Phase 7
"confirmed absent" language is wrong and should be corrected in a future
documentation pass. The only genuinely open residuals (WSL in-guest
process-tree cleanup on Kali timeout; a truncated-valid-prefix-on-load test
fixture) are each too narrow for a milestone alone, and a real unified
error taxonomy is either decorative or architecturally large (2,300+ raise
sites) — neither is a bounded next milestone.

Direct inspection of `src/research/ResearchMissionAudit.py` found a real,
still-open gap instead, matching Master_Roadmap.md Phase 4's `[ ]`
"Provenance visualization": `build_mission_audit`'s `_traceability()`
function already computes a complete provenance graph (claim -> evidence ->
source observation -> discovery candidate; contradiction -> claims ->
evidence; comparison review -> note -> evidence -> sources; revalidation ->
paired observations), but `ResearchMissionAuditApplicationService` only
exposes it through a 24,000-character-truncated flat Markdown preview
(`MAX_MISSION_AUDIT_PREVIEW_CHARACTERS`) and a two-file export-to-disk
action (`TkinterDesktopWindow.py`, no structured in-app traceability
browsing exists anywhere at milestone-lock time).
An operator must leave the app and open the exported files to see a
mission's actual provenance structure.

Scope: (1) a new typed, frozen, Tkinter-independent graph read-model type in
`src/research/` (hypatia-epistemics) that re-shapes `_traceability()`'s
existing output into explicit nodes/edges — zero new relations, zero new
inference, unresolved references stay explicitly unresolved exactly as
`_traceability()` already reports them; (2) a new read-only Brain intent on
`ResearchMissionAuditApplicationService` (hypatia-runtime) built from the
exact same `build_mission_audit(...)` call `render()`/`_preview()` already
use — no new computation path, no mutation, no network/model/provider call;
(3) a new read-only `ttk.Treeview` widget in the desktop app (hypatia-runtime)
letting an operator expand claim/evidence/source/contradiction/comparison-
review/revalidation chains in-app, reusing existing safe-text normalization
for untrusted source titles/URLs. Existing preview/save export behavior is
completely unchanged (strictly additive third way to see the same
already-computed data). Landed placement (confirmed during implementation):
the "3 Authored analysis" -> "Plan draft" sub-tab, directly beside the
pre-existing mission-audit export buttons it was scoped against — not
"4 Review & export" as originally assumed when this milestone was locked;
see CHANGELOG.md/PROJECT_STATUS.md v0.3.399 for the corrected location.

Non-goals: no new inference (no automatic independence/freshness/mirror/
syndication detection); no change to `build_mission_audit`'s computed
semantics or the existing Markdown/JSON export format; no new persistence,
store or schema version; no new authority/budget/approval primitive; no
cross-mission graph; no canvas/force-directed rendering (`ttk.Treeview` is
sufficient and avoids new rendering-security surface); no changes to
Evaluate -> Adapt, revalidation, cancellation or persistence-store code.

Permanent invariants affected: none. This is a pure read-only presentation
layer over already-computed, already-tested canonical data; it introduces
no authority, no budget, no target, no credential and no inferred
provenance.

Post-merge verification (2026-09-22, hypatia-lead): PR #378 base `main`,
head `feature/structured-learned-memory-extraction-v0.3.118`, carried
exactly 3 commits (v0.3.399 plus the two already-reviewed prior dev-infra
guard-narrowing commits `2d7005b`/`b1c0354`, both also confirmed reachable
from `origin/main`), 17 files, `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`, both PR-triggered
checks `SUCCESS`. Merged with `gh pr merge 378 --merge --subject "..."` —
the guard's narrowed auto-allow accepted this exact routine shape with no
interactive confirmation prompt, the first live test of that permission
change, and it passed. Author/committer identity on all three carried
commits confirmed unchanged (Songül Kızılay via GitHub noreply email).

`aeff7713a8fea7efd247892272c78a80b9d16176`) both remain reachable from
`origin/main` as ancestors of v0.3.399 (this row), which is now the
current last-delivered product milestone.

Developer-infrastructure changes (for example the Claude team setup) are not
product milestones and do not bump the version.
