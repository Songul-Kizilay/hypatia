## Unreleased

### Added

- Local JSON persistence for structured memory and session registry snapshots,
  including atomic writes and explicit failure handling.
- Session creation, activation, overview, details, activity, recent-history,
  conversation search, rename preview/commit, delete preview/commit, and
  guarded transactional deletion.
- Deterministic cognitive orchestration for knowledge search, planning,
  explicit recall, session commands, and optional LLM conversations.
- Learned-memory candidate extraction, append-only correction history,
  bounded context composition, keyword selection, deterministic ranking, and
  configurable ranked top-k selection.
- OpenAI-compatible chat-completions transport with an optional system prompt
  and bounded same-session conversation history.
- A dependency-free semantic retrieval core: validated immutable embeddings,
  an embedding-provider boundary, and a derived in-memory cosine-similarity
  index with deterministic ordering and a fresh-index builder for active
  memory records.
- An explicit stdlib-based Ollama `/api/embed` adapter with strict single-vector
  response validation, opt-in Bootstrap activation, and atomic replacement of
  the last successful derived index. After startup, lifecycle events keep the
  derived index current without allowing embedding failures to disrupt primary
  memory writes.
- A validated configurable local embedding-transport timeout with a 120-second
  default for cold local-model startup.
- A bounded `semantic recall <query>` path that exposes similarity scores only
  for current-session conversation records and falls back to deterministic
  lexical recall when semantic retrieval is unavailable or empty.
- A pure reciprocal-rank fusion evaluator with a versioned hybrid-ranking
  fixture corpus; it is evaluation-only and does not alter runtime ordering.

### Changed

- Restored a complete MyPy quality gate for both `src` and `tests` by making
  package-base discovery explicit and aligning test doubles with their runtime
  contracts.
- Made the full unittest command package-aware so nested test directories are
  included without shadowing source packages.

### Verification

- The package-aware full local suite contains 805 passing automated tests.
- Black, Ruff, MyPy, and whitespace validation pass in the local development
  environment.
